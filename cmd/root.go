edgectl is a lightweight command-line interface for managing Edge Cloud resources.

It streamlines tasks such as provisioning clusters, joining nodes, managing configurations,
and interacting with secure secrets storage — all tailored for edge environments.

Whether you're deploying a new RKE2 cluster, automating node registration, or storing
kubeconfigs securely in Vault, edgectl helps you orchestrate your edge infrastructure with ease.
